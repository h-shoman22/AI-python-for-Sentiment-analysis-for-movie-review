# AI Text Classification Project

This repository contains a Python script generated from a Jupyter Notebook that performs text classification on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. 
The project uses various machine learning techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Loads the IMDB movie reviews dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes steps to understand the dataset, such as visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans the text data by removing HTML tags, stopwords, and applying stemming.
- **Modeling**: Implements machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and a Neural Network using Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- BeautifulSoup4
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk beautifulsoup4 matplotlib keras tensorflow
